In this project, we developed a web application aimed at enhancing user
experience and streamlining specific tasks related to the online sale of computer
peripherals, including keyboards, headphones, and CPUs. The application was built
using a modern tech stack including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP for the
backend. Our primary objective was to create a responsive, user-friendly interface
that allows users to efficiently manage their tasks and track their progress. We
employed an iterative development process. Key features of the application include
user authentication, real-time data synchronization, and customizable dashboards.
Through this project, we gained valuable experience in full-stack development and
improved our skills in collaborative coding and project management. The final
product is a fully functional online store that showcases our ability to develop and
deploy a comprehensive e-commerce platform, providing a solid foundation for
future work and further enhancements

## Project Requirements

The company tracks orders, each identified by a unique id, associated with a user
(user_id as a foreign key), and records whether the order is complete
(is_complete), the date the order was placed (date_order), and the delivery
address (address). Categories are defined with a unique id, a name, and a
description.
Order details are stored in the order_product table, which includes a unique id, and
foreign keys to the order (order_id), product (product_id), and user (user_id), along
with the quantity ordered (quantity).
Reviews are tracked with a unique id, and include the user (user_id as a foreign
key) and product (product_id as a foreign key), along with the rating (rate). Users
have a unique id, name, password, first name (fname), last name (lname), address,
and a role (e.g., admin, customer).
Product images are stored with a unique id, the associated product (product_id as
a foreign key), and the path to the image file (path).
Products are identified by a unique id, and include a name, price, manufacturer
(manufacturer), category (cat_id as a foreign key), description, date added
(date_added), tags (tag), total quantity (quantity), and available quantity
(quantity_available).
